    "\n",
    "3. Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact?\n",
    "- Yes, these insights are valuable for content acquisition and localization strategies. If a country has a strong showing in TV Shows, Netflix might consider licensing or co-producing more TV content there to match audience interest. It also helps identify content gaps by country and type. On the flip side, if certain markets show a lopsided distribution (e.g., very few TV Shows from a major region), it could alienate users looking for that type of content, possibly leading to regional dissatisfaction and negative growth if not addressed.\n"
